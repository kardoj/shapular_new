Structure of the levels
-----------------------
Graphical level data is saved in img/levels directory. Each levels has its own directory
with whatever name. Level names and directories are linked together in the database. Every
level directory MUST CONTAIN a file called frame.png which represents the shape to be
made in that level. Individual part files can be named anything but using numbers (1.png, 2.png ...)
is recommended. All the files are linked to a level in the database. frame.png is not saved
in database because it is always centered and part coordinates are saved relative to center (so
it is possible to use different resolutions). Every level also has to have a file called
thumb.png (180px * 180px) which is shown in the level selection screen.
